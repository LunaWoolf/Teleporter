Hi,Brette!
Are you still doing that delivery job?
Be careful with these monitors.
You will lose the job if you expose yourself under them for too long.
I hope the curfew will end soon…
But now, people say that the temporary government is using these monitor
If these computers notice that you are out for too long
Your city id will be invalid.
And you know you can't go anywhere without that.
So be careful, kid.
