{PlayerName()}, I think Ginny would tell me if she'd designed you. #line:00100a
She doesn’t seem like someone who would pull such a prank. #line:00100b
She’s a super bad liar. She can’t keep secrets. #line:00100c
Or it’s just because I know her too well, I can tell when she is lying.#line:00100d
<<wait 60>>
Hey {PlayerName()}, sometimes I want to move to another city,#line:00200a
But I did some research, and it turns out: #line:00200b
All cities are equally crap #line:00200c
so there is no point in running away. #line:00200d  
<<wait 20>>
I don’t dislike my hometown.#line:00600a
It’s just…very different from the City.#line:00600b
But that’s okay.#line:00600c
I don’t want it to change.#line:00600d
I don’t want my hometown to be like the City,#line:00600e
just like I don’t want the City to get any similar to my home.#line:00600f
I guess what I’m trying to say is, #line:00600g
I like them being different.#line:00600h
Cause then it makes me think that I was different when I moved to the City.#line:00600i
<<wait 40>> 
I like to climb to the top of the tallest building in the City. #line:00500a
It reminds me of climbing this huge tree back in my hometown.#line:00500b
I'm not sure if that tree is still alive, though…#line:00500c
I think it's pretty old, and I'm afraid it passed away#line:00500d
But if it's alive, I would love to bring you to see it one day,{PlayerName()}.#line:00500e

{PlayerName()},Can I ask you a question?#line:00700a
I always want to ask,#line:00700b
Why did you choose me?#line:00700c
I mean...this power is kind of useless to me.#line:00700d
Not blaming you, I mean, it's not your fault.#line:00700e
It's just...If you give somebody else this incredible power,#line:00700f
they could do much more meaningful stuff with it.#line:00700g
Instead of just delivering food...#line:00700h
<<wait 10>>
Hey {PlayerName()}, we are listening to an UnRead song right now.#line:00800a
A lot of people dislike them because of their frontman, Yur#line:00800b
He has a very weird singing voice#line:00800c
But that’s exactly why I love them.#line:00800d
His vocals remind me of my hometown:#line:00800e
the muddy road, the harsh wind,#line:00800f
and the smell of stillness and rivers. #line:00800g
He has a really special voice.#line:00800h
Also, he has a weird personality, but that’s another story.#line:00800i
<<wait 3>>
And their drummer, Tong Tong.#line:00900a
She is so cool!!#line:00900b
But I once saw a picture of her when she was still in high school.#line:00900c
She looks completely different in that picture.#line:00900d
Back then, She seems a little…nerdy.#line:00900e
And that makes me think:#line:00900f
If she could change that much after high school,#line:00900g
Maybe I could too.#line:00900h
<<wait 3>>
When the band first comes out, #line:01000a
Corvus, the guitarist, is the most popular member among fans.#line:01000b
I mean, just look at him!#line:01000c
He looks flawless!#line:01000d
I wish I could be stylish like him.#line:01000e
But I’m too short… His outfits only work on tall people.#line:01000f
<<wait 3>>
Ah, I really, really want to see them perform on the music festival#line:01100a
I hope I can save enough money for the ticket.#line:01100b
<<wait 20>>
I hate the rain. #line:00300a
I hope it doesn’t mess up my headphones. #line:00300b
I don’t think they're waterproof. #line:00300c
<<wait 20>>
I used to have a friend who played guitar really well #line:00400a
I haven't heard from him for a while.#line:00400b
